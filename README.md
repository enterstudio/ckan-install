## Further notes
This project is developed following CKAN install guides. If something's missing in the guide, then the project might be
missing the same thing.

If using CKAN 2.2 or lower consider upgrading to CKAN 2.3 or later, because of resource_proxy:

>As resource views are rendered on the browser, if the file they are accessing is located in a different 
>domain than the one CKAN is hosted, the browser will block access to it because of the same-origin policy. For instance, 
>files hosted on www.example.com wonâ€™t be able to be accessed from the browser if CKAN is hosted on data.catalog.com.
>
>To allow view plugins access to external files you need to activate the resource_proxy plugin on your configuration file:
>
>```
>ckan.resource_proxy.max_file_size
>```
